# Contributions to the Analysis of the Industrial Production Index in the Canary
Islands throug Machine Learning

In the present repository an analysis and prediction of the
Industrial Production Index has been carried out using Entropy
Transfer studies between the index and other series
collected throug The Spanish Stadistic Institute. These results
have been use to make predictions of the future of this
index by a Recurrent Neural Networks, in particular, the socalled
LSTM. The results have been compared with those
obtained by a simple neural network with only a hidden
layer and classic statistical methods such as the so-called
Nave Forecasting and the Arima method.

## Introduction
The Industrial Production Index, (IPI), is an index of the
development of industrial activities within a country or an
autonomous community. Through this work, a study of this
time series has been carried out.
In particular, the influence of other time series obtained
through the statistic institute has been measured in said index
and vice versa by the measure of entropy transfer. This
entropy transfer measure is based on the theory of information
and mutual information, tools used in computation,
now applied to data analysis.
Once this first study had been carried out, predictions of
the future of this index were made by using Recurrent Neural
Networks, in particular the so-called LSTM, applying
the results obtained by way of the entropy transfer study to
obtain better results on the network.
The results are compared with those obtained by simply
using a version of the auto-regressive method by means of a
simple neural network with only a hidden layer and classic
statistical methods such as the so-called Nave Forecasting
and the Arima method.
